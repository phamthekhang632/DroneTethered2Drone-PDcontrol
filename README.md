# Drone tethered to drone stablization using PD control.
This is final project for MMAE540 - Robotics class. The project simulated a two-drone system, tehtered to each other by 100 meters rope, and stablize the rope using PD control. 
<br/>
The final product is done in MATLAB. However, there are some simulation at the early stage written in Python. The file require [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) for visualization.
